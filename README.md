Implement a bandit algorithm to simulate simultaneous anchor node selection by one target in a PNT system. The
algorithm should select three anchor nodes at each time step and calculate the accuracy (reward) of position estimation
using the trilateration technique.

Step 1: Initialize the problem parameters

Step 2: Implement the Bandit Algorithm

Step 3: Plot and analyze the results
