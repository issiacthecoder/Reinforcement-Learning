Find me if you can!

In this code assignment (in Python!), you will be implementing a bandit algorithm with an application in Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) systems. The task involves simulating how a target can select three anchor nodes
simultaneously to improve its position estimation accuracy using a bandit algorithm. The accuracy of the position
estimation will be determined using the trilateration technique. Trilateration is a method used to determine the
position of a target based on the time differences of arrival (TDOA) of signals from multiple reference points, known
as anchor nodes. By measuring the pseudoranges, of the target from each selected anchor node, the targetâ€™s position
can be estimated by intersecting spheres centered at the anchor nodes.

Implement a bandit algorithm to simulate simultaneous anchor node selection by one target in a PNT system. The
algorithm should select three anchor nodes at each time step and calculate the accuracy (reward) of position estimation
using the trilateration technique.

Step 1: Initialize the problem parameters

Step 2: Implement the Bandit Algorithm

Step 3: Plot and analyze the results
